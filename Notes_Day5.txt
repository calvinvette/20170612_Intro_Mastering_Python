Break + Lab 17 until 11:55
Let me know in the chat log when you're done.
If everyone's done early, we'll move on early.
Make sure you get your break though.

Let me know if you have questions or need help.
Muted for now.



HTTP Requests
GET - for idempotent reads, data is bookmarkable, limited to URL_LENGTH (2k)
POST - for submitting data
	Data is in HTTP Body, not bookmarkable
	No imposed limit on data
	Can include encoded binary files (in multipart form)
	In HTML5/REST paradigm, is used to INSERT data
PUT - like POST, but used in HTML5/REST for UPDATEing data
DELETE - like POST, but used in HTML5/REST for DELETEing data

Basic CRUD functions
Create == POST == INSERT
Read == GET == SELECT
Update == PUT == UPDATE
Delete == DELETE == DELETE

Other HTTP verbs include OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE, PATCH, ...

All HTTP Utilities (including browsers) default to GET unless explicitly
told otherwise
	curl, wget
	XHR (AJAX) in browsers
	Python urllib.request
	Python requests module (pip install requests)
	All other language libraries


Request-Response Cycle
Request has Header & Body
Response has Header & Body
Header includes URL, cookies, 
	HTTP Headers (Content-Type, Accept, Accept-Language, etc.)
	Transfer-Encoding,


Don't use FTP - use Paramiko SFTP
Wherever possible, use private key/public key authentication (not password-based)
Windows SSH equivalent is "winrs" (is it encrypted???)
