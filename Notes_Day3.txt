Separately, please let me know when you're done with Lab 10 in the chat log :-)


Just a few more minutes for folks to wrap up or find a convenient stopping point then we'll get started at 3:20



Then I'll cover pip and some key libraries


You're welcome to do labs as long as you'd like, even while I'm
talking about pip and friends. I'll be here late working
on my own stuff and won't close the session until after everyone
else has left. I'll be available to help if you need/want it.

If you only have time for one lab, do Lab 12

You're all invited to come back tomorrow morning as well to finish
off labs and/or go through the debrief.
