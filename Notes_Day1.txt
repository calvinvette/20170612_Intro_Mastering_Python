Disadvantages of Python (apparently blank slide):

	* 2.x vs. 3.x breakage (python vs. python3, pip vs. pip3)
	* Spaces instead of braces (and/or tabs... grrr...)

	function foo() {
		console.log("foo");
	}


def foo:
    print "foo"
print "bar"


	* Not all modules compile on all platforms
		Esp. more exotic things CUDA/OpenCL/DSP/FPGA, device drivers



How to Get Python
Manual Compile:
	0. Windows users - download Cygwin to do this (make sure you install at least bash, tar, make, mingw gcc/g++, and md5sum)
	1. DO NOT RUN AS ROOT
	2. download tarball. (Go to python.org download section, select the version you want, then find the 
		"GZipped Tarball"
		3.6.1: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.1/Python-3.6.1.tgz
	3. Verify the MD5 sum
		Make sure it matches the md5sum for the version you downloaded on the website
		md5sum Python-3.6.1.tgz
		Should give you: 2d0fc9f3a5940707590e07f03ecb08b9
	4. Extract
	5. ./configure
	6. make
	7. sudo make install
		For windows users, open a command prompt with "Run As Administrator" and do the make install.
